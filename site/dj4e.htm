<h1>This is just a starting point</h1>
<p>Construct your HTML following the instructions below.</p>
<div>
    <p>This is the required paragraph. <span>This text is within span.</span> I think that was pretty <strong>bold</strong> of me to <em>highlight</em> that fact so obsiously.</p>
    <p>The list below will contain hyperlinks (anchor tags).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/">Link one</a></li>
      <li><a href="/">Link two</a></li>
      <li><a href="/">Link three</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>When you have finished your HTML *and* it passes the HTML
 validator, you can submit it to the autograder.</p>
